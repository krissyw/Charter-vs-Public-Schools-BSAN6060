# Charter-vs-Public-Schools-BSAN6060

## Background 

### Business Problem 

There is a wide disparity in student performance in public schools, especially those located in low-income areas, and private schools. Private schools sufficiently prepare students for academic success since they have more resources and lower student-teacher ratios. In contrast, public schools in low-income neighborhoods struggle to support their students academically since they have fewer resources and overcrowded classrooms. In 1992, California enacted the Charter School Law to introduce the charter school, a hybrid institution that has characteristics of a public and private school. Like public schools, charter schools are free and funded by the government. Like private schools, charter schools have capped admissions and an application process before enrollment. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61371423/166078618-fb52a737-ae53-4c5f-a506-e9c46e3d6a13.png)
